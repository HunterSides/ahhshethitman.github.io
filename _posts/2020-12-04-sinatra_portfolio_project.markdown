For this project I was assigned to create a CRUD/MVC web app using Sinatra with Activerecord. 
I decided to create a web app that I could use personally in my spare time, so thus the idea for PUBG Stat Tracker was created. In my spare time I play the game PUBG semi professionally and  we are constantly looking for an advantage when it comes to the competition. Through VOD review and stat analysis gaining the upperhand is very important. Creating PUBG Stat Tracker will help me and my teammates record previous game data and give us the tools to analyze our performance for past games....hopefully turning that semi-pro in to just pro. 

Creating this app was fun and easy, learning how MVC relationships work is something I've come to enjoy and really appreciate. MVC relations takes something that on the surface seems complicated and breaks it down into a heirarchy that is easily understandable.
