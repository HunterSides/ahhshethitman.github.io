So my first project started off pretty slow to say the least, I first started this project a few months ago...yes I said it a few months ago. At the start I was gung ho about the project but ran into MANY obstacles which made me lose motivation quickly and my progress came to a stand still. Until one day I finally broke through whatever barrier was holding me back and I was finally able to find the motivation to actually finish. 

From the start I wanted to create a CLI application that was personal, so I decided to make one that I could use after I was done with the Flatiron program, thus "Top 100 places to work in Austin" was created. 

This project scrapes the top 100 companies in Austin based on www.builtinaustin.com and ultimately gives the user a multi level interaction based off of their company of choosing. 

I will say its not 100% the way I would like it but it functions and its mine!
